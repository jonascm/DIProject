# DIProject
By Jonas Cuadrado, Feb 4th, 2018

Contains some of the codes and the plots for the Data Incubator project

To run the codes, download the txt data files I generated on excel, and download the codes. Run them in order, 1 to 6. 
Make sure you have at least 30GB of free space. 

The first code downloads 10500 files, one for each year, each buoy, circa 25.5 GB. 
The second one eliminates data without wave information, and consolidates years, taking 2.7GB. 
Third and 4th do the same but with the buoy properties, not their meteorological information. 
Code 5 merges all in a 1.6 GB pandas-based csv file.
Run code 6 to generate some of the data I show.
